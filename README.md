# Flight Fare Prediction - a Classic Time Series Project
* Flight fare prediction is a classical problem of time series forecasting that finds trends in past observations to outline the future
* In this project, I have build a Python Flight Fare Prediction App, that returns the fare prediction for a given set of travel details, like:  departure date, arrival date, departure city, arrival city, stoppages, and the airline carrier.
* The Airline Flight Fare Prediction project is to predict airline flight fares across the Indian cities. 
* The dataset for the project is taken from Kaggle, and it is a time-stamped dataset so, while building the model, extensive pre-processing was done on the dataset especially on the date-time columns to finally come up with a ML model which could effectively predict airline fares across various Indian Cities. 
* The dataset had many features which had to pre-processed and transformed into new parameters for a cleaner and simple web application layout to predict the fares.
